## What is Vue Grid Layout?

@energiency/vue-grid-layout is a fork of [vue-grid-layout](https://github.com/jbaysolutions/vue-grid-layout). It's a grid layout system, like [Gridster](http://dsmorse.github.io/gridster.js/), for Vue 2.2+. **Heavily inspired by [React-Grid-Layout](https://github.com/STRML/react-grid-layout)**

## Features

* Draggable widgets
* Resizable widgets
* Static widgets
* Bounds checking for dragging and resizing
* Widgets may be added or removed without rebuilding grid
* Layout can be serialized and restored
* Automatic RTL support (resizing not working with RTL on 2.2.0)
* Responsive
